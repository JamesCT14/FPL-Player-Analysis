# FPL Fantasy Football Player Analysis
Welcome to the FPL Fantasy Football Player Analysis project! This repository contains code and resources to gather, analyze, and visualize player performance data from the Premier League and FBREF websites. The goal of this project is to provide fantasy football managers with valuable insights into player performance, aiding in the selection of top-performing and value players for their fantasy teams.

## Introduction
Fantasy Premier League (FPL) is a popular online fantasy football game where participants create virtual teams composed of real-life Premier League players. The performance of these players in actual Premier League matches contributes to the team's score. This project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of player performance data to assist FPL managers in making informed decisions about their fantasy teams.

## Features
+ Data scraping from the Premier League website and FBREF using Python and Selenium.
+ Utilization of the Premier League API to access player statistics.
+ Compilation and organization of player performance data.
+ Creation of an interactive Tableau dashboard to visualize data.
+ Comparative analysis of player statistics.
+ Visualization of top-performing players, player comparisons, transfers, and price changes.

## Data Collection
We collect data using Python and Selenium automation. The script FPL-Full-Script.ipynb scrapes data from the Premier League website and FBREF, respectively. The dataset is not big and is therefore copied to a google sheet which is then the data source for Tableau dashboards. Make sure to customize these scripts to suit your requirements.

## Data Analysis & Visualization
Python scripts are provided to process and organize the collected data. These scripts handle data cleaning, transformation, and compilation into formats suitable for analysis. The data is then connected to Tableau. See the link below to the interactive storyboard analysis.
